- 📫 How to reach me: johndurtka@gmail.com

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: The final project for my 4Geeks Academy coding bootcamp, which will be a website for a small dog-walking/pet-sitting business.

- Projects I like to do for fun: Games! 🎮 I don't actually know any C# or anything though, so it's just been simple stuff so far.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Some of my first experience with programming was actually using ZZT-OOP from the old game ZZT to make game levels with custom code!
